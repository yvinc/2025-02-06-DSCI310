### Even More on Docker:

``` bash
docker run \
    --rm \
    -it
    -e PASSWORD="password" \
    -p 8787:8787 \
    - v /$(pwd):/home/rstudio/pizza
    rocker/rstutio:4.4.2
```

> This command is to be run in the terminal. Same as when we don't have
> all the Â and indentation. This format is really for better viewing. -
> The most important part of this is really `-e PASSWORD="password"` and
> `-p 8787:8787`. - `-v` (dash volume) is take the current directory
> `pizza` and "mount" it onto the container folder--allows us to get
> one-to-one synchronization between the local and the container.

-   `yml.` file makes this current command and save it in a way that
    docker understands. \> If you try to copy and paste this command
    into terminal, you won't be able to edit it in the terminal, but
    you'd able to actively edit it within the .yml file:). \> Create
    `docker-compose.yml`.

All this docker compose yml does is taking this command and takes pieces
and components from the command: - First line `services` tells docker
what it wants to include with a 'special name'. We'd want to specify
this name manually: 'analysis-env' **The `tidyverse` container image
doesn't work with MacOS:(, but we can just work with the RStudio
containe** - Order doesn't really matter with image, ports. - `yml` is a
little bit weird in a sense that sometimes it uses dashes (-) for
listing (typically if the parameter can take in multiple values, like
for `ports:`), sometimes it doesn't. - For `volumes:`, we don't need to
include `/$(pwd)` component. - Volumes are for **what we want to
mount**. - Take all folders we have in our current directory, and create
a new folder and shove everything in it. - If `pizza` is already in the
home directory, this mounted `pizza` will overwrite it. - You typically
**DON'T** see mounting into the home directory directly, this is why we
typically want to mount into a directory that is not `home`. - For
`environment:` - Will differ depending on different containers. - Note:
because we do want to version control this `yml` file, the fact that we
have a password here isn't ideal. This is okay in this containers - BUT:
DO NOT put your personal access token into these file!!
```
services: analysis-env: image: rocker/rstudio:4.4.2 ports: - "8787:8787"
volumes: - .:/home/rstudio/pizza environment: PASSWORD: "password"
```
> This docker compose file will completely reproduces the docker
> command!! (Yaay) - We can run **`docker compose up`** in our

In the Rocker documentation, there's the variable **`DISABLE_AUTH`** and
set it to true: - Bypasses the login where you no longer need to log in
the port service. - How do we translate to yml? - This parameter will go
under the environment:

```         
services: 
analysis-env: 
    image: rocker/rstudio:4.4.2
    ports:
        - "8787:8787"
    volumes:
        - .:/home/rstudio/pizza
    environment:
        PASSWORD: "password"
        **DISABLE_AUTH: true**
```

**Note not to mess up the identation of the yml. file. Consult class
note for an example yml. file for exam purposes!**

-   We can also run 2 containers at the same time, but we have to give
    them different names:
```
services: analysis-env: image: rocker/rstudio:4.4.2 ports: -
"**8787**:8787" volumes: - .:/home/rstudio/pizza environment: PASSWORD:
"password"
```

```         
analysis-env2:
    image: rocker/rstudio:4.4.2
    ports:
        - "**8788**:8787"
    volumes:
        - .:/home/rstudio/pizza
    environment:
        PASSWORD: "password"
```

-   In terminal, run also **`docker compose rm`** to ensure we're out of
    all the ports.

-   In Docker world, everything has to be run through bash command.

-   What happens if we want other packages in the container?

-   e.g.) Let's say we want to install another R package (e.g., Git),
    but I don't want to go into the container every other time to
    re-install the same package over and over.

    -   That's to day, we want to customize our container.

    -   We can create a new file under our current lecture folder called
        `Dockerfile`:

In our `Dockerfile`: FROM rocker/rsudio:4.4.2

> Next, in the terminal, run **`docker build --tag mycontainer .`** to
> build the container. - Everytime we edited the Dockerfile, we would
> have to rerun to rebuild the container. **Make sure this step of
> rebuilding is done repeatedly.** - `.` specifies that all files are
> starting from the current working directory. - When we run this, the
> Docker build system will lock at the Dockerfile and build a container
> based on this file line-by-line. - Now we'll hav eour new container
> called `mycontainer` after we run this:)!

Now how do we use this container? - We can edit the compose file and
instead of having `image: rocker/rstudio:4.4.2`, we can now instead
write: `image: mycontainer`. - The Dockerfile specifies only the
`image`, as such, all the rest of the `.yml` docker-compose file is
still needed:
```
services: analysis-env: image: mycontainer ports: - "**7777**:8787"
volumes: - .:/home/rstudio/pizza environment: PASSWORD: "password"
```
-   Running `localhost/7777` in browser will now run the container we've
    specified in the Dockerfile.

For example now, we want `renv` in this container, but how do we
customize our container such that it allows `renv`? - In internal, we
can install new package by running: `Rscript -e <R code>` - For example:
`Rscript -e <R code> "print('hello')"`. - In Dockerfile: \> The `repos=`
parameter is needed because the user need manually run these command to
pre-select the mirror of the package since there can't be any user input
during the installation process to select the mirror (non-interactive
mode).

> FROM rocker/rsudio:4.4.2
>
> RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('renv', repos = c(CRAN =
> '<https://cloud.r-project.org>'))"

#### Homework:

install specific package in the repository with a specific package
version: RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('renv', repos = c(CRAN =
'<https://cloud.r-project.org>'))" RUN Rscript -e
"install.packages('remotes', repos = c(CRAN =
'<https://cloud.r-project.org>'))"

-   We can create the renv system locally on the computer, and then we
    use this renv with Docker (serarch up the Docker documentation in R,
    read / copy Appraoch one and follow instruction there beginning from
    `COPY renv.lock /home/rsudio/renv.lock`):
-   Create a lock file and copy:

> FROM rocker/rsudio:4.4.2
>
> RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('renv', repos = c(CRAN =
> '<https://cloud.r-project.org>'))" RUN Rscript -e
> "install.packages('remotes', repos = c(CRAN =
> '<https://cloud.r-project.org>'))"
>
> COPY renv.lock /home/rsudio/renv.lock

### How do I take this container (and image) from my local and share it?

#### Docker Hub:

-   When we use rocker/rstudio:4.4.2, there's a service within rocker
    with the repo 'rstudio' that can be shared.
-   First we need to login to docker with the command:
    > `docker login -u chendanialy`
    -   `-u` stands for user name.
    -   Don't just type in `docker login alone`.
-   To get our docker up to the hub, we will change our way of building
    our container by including our username: \>
    **`docker build --tag **chendaniely**/mycontainer .`**
-   When a command gets changed, Docker will only run the added command
    (yayy) so that it doesn't re-run the previously 'loaded' package
    again.

Then finally run: \> `docker push chendanialy/mycontainer`

-   We can then be able to see our container on dockerhub when we search
    up our own username (e.g., `chendanialy` in this example).
-   When we use this container with this image, we need to make sure we
    build the edited container, push it onto Docker Hub so that the new
    image is now .

### How to automate the build process?

#### GitHub Action (chapter 12, end of page)

> <https://ubc-dsci.github.io/reproducible-and-trustworthy-workflows-for-data-science/lectures/120-containerization-3.html>

1.  Copy the script on textbook

-   Handles all the automation such that whenever changes is made to
    Docker file or when we manually run it, trigger update on the Github
    repository!
-   Tell github to login to your account.
-   Then build the docker.
-   Push the image onto Docker Hub automatically.

2.  Create 2 folders in our repository:

-   First folder is called `.github`
-   Within `.github`, create `workflows`.
    -   These folder names are specific, because Github knows how to
        read these names.

3.  Create `docker.yml` within `workflows`

-   This is a `.yml` that Github understands.

4.  Within `.yml`, paste (from ch.12 in textbook):

```         
# Publishes docker image, pinning actions to a commit SHA,
# and updating most recently built image with the latest tag.
# Can be triggered by either pushing a commit that changes the `Dockerfile`,
# or manually dispatching the workflow.

name: Publish Docker image

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'Dockerfile'
      - 'conda-linux-64.lock'

jobs:
  push_to_registry:
    name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
        with:
          images: ttimbers/dsci522-dockerfile-practice
          tags: |
            type=raw, value={{sha}},enable=${{github.ref_type != 'tag' }}
            type=raw, value=latest

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```

> Note `images` name needs to be changed.

5.  Push the new folder onto Github.

6.  Go to Gitaction on Github, intiate the workflow there.

7.  `secretes and variables`, go to `action`:

-   Create `new repository secretes`
-   Looking for `DOCKER_USERNAME`, type in your username as the value.
-   Then go in again for `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, type in your user password.

8.  Now re-run all failed jobs, which passes all login info.
9.  We now should be able to see the image is being built in Github
    action.
10. Note that the `images` should contain your own username. Add,
    commit, and push the file.
11. Rerun the failed job on Git action.
